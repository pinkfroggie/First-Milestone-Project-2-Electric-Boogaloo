# First-Milestone-Project-2-Electric-Boogaloo

a tic-tac-toe game inspired by all shades of pink. pretty self-explanatory. uses the objectively cute, rounded font of ubuntu and includes the occasional heart and sparkle. the only main bug is the new game button moving when the winner message pops up. it usually resets when the winner message disappears.
